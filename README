# Simple script for verifying Cockpit pull requests.

Hubbot is simplistic and not polished at all, but it might be useful
nevertheless.

DO NOT RUN HUBBOT YOURSELF!  IT ONLY WORKS CORRECTLY IN ITS SPECIAL
ENVIRONMENT ON OUR CI MACHINE.

But you might find the "trigger-hubbot" utility useful.  It can tell
hubbot to work on a pull request, probably to retry a bogus failure.
This could also be used to explicitly white-list pull requests from
external contributors, but that doesn't work yet.

The rest of this README is only about trigger-hubbot.

## Installing

"make install" will copy trigger-hubbot to /usr/local/bin.

## Setup

Put something like this into $HOME/.hubbotrc:

    { 'github_token': "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
      'user_whitelist': [],
      'master_repo': "cockpit-project/cockpit",
      'dry_run': False,
      'remote': False,
      'os_arch': [('fedora-22', 'f22', 'x86_64', 0, 0),('rhel-7', 'r7', 'x86_64', -1, 2)]],
      'default': ('fedora-22', 'f22', 'x86_64'),
      'priority_default': 0,
      'priority_needs_attention': 1,
      'priority_work_in_progress': 2,
      'priority_penalty_other_config': 1,
      'priority_penalty_master': 1
    }

'dry_run' if this is true, no changes are pushed to github.

'remote' specifies if hubbot runs on a remote server. If True, the hubbot.work files
will be looked for via http if they aren't found locally.

'os_arch' entries consist of: (os name, short name, architecture, offset_master, offset_pull)
Of these, os name and architecture will be used to find the correct images,
whereas the short name is used for status messages.
'offset_master' and 'offset_pull' will be added to priorities with this configuration.

Priorities:
By default, all tasks are assigned priority_default.
For pull requests, the github labels and title are considered:
    priority_needs_attention (labels "needsdesign", "needswork")
    priority_work_in_progress (title begins with WIP, case insensitive)
When checking master, priority_penalty_master is added.
When using a non-default configuration, priority_penalty_other_config is added.
The penalties priority_penalty_master and priority_penalty_other_config stack.

The github_token is used to access the GitHub API.  You can create one
for your account at

    https://github.com/settings/applications

When generating a new personal access token, the scope only needs to
encompass public_repo (or repo if you're accessing a private repo).

## Running

To mark pull request number NNN as 'pending', run

    $ trigger-hubbot NNN

This will update the status of the current head commit of the given
pull request in a special way, and hubbot will eventually pick it up
for verification.

If the pull request is target at some other repo than
cockpit-project/cockpit, you can pass it as well:

    $ trigger-hubbot cgwalters/cockpit NNN
