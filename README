# Simple script for verifying Cockpit pull requests.

Hubbot is simplistic and not polished at all, but it might be useful
nevertheless.

The main point is to work with a fresh clone of the repo so that the
main hacking repo isn't blocked while the test suite runs.

## Installing

"make install" will copy hubbot to /usr/local/bin.

## Setup

Put something like this into $HOME/.hubbotrc:

    { 'github_token': "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }

The github_token is used to access the GitHub API.

Hubbot sets TEST_DATA to $HOME/cockpit-data, so put your base tarballs
and images there.

Create the $HOME/hubbot directory.

## Running

To verify pull request number NNN, run

    $ hubbot NNN

If successful, this will add a comment to the pull request.

If the pull request is target at some other repo than
cockpit-project/cockpit, you can pass it as well:

    $ hubbot cgwalters/cockpit NNN
