# Simple script for verifying Cockpit pull requests.

Hubbot is simplistic and not polished at all, but it might be useful
nevertheless.

The main point is to work with a fresh clone of the repo so that the
main hacking repo isn't blocked while the test suite runs.

## Installing

"make install" will copy hubbot to /usr/local/bin.

## Setup

Put something like this into $HOME/.hubbotrc:

    { 'github_token': "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
      'user_whitelist': [ "mvollmer", ... ]
    }

The github_token is used to access the GitHub API.  The user whitelist
is used to avoid working on pull request from untrusted sources.

Hubbot sets TEST_DATA to $HOME/cockpit-data, so put your base tarballs
and images there.

Create the $HOME/hubbot directory.

## Running

To verify pull request number NNN, run

    $ hubbot NNN

This will update the status of the current head commit of the given
pull request, similar to Travis CI.  (Note that this doesn't do any
policy checks, such as looking into the user whitelist.)

If you pass "-" as the pull request, hubbot will check all open pull
requests and work on the first one that needs verification and whose
creator is in the 'user_whitelist' mentioned above.

If you pass "+" as the pull request, hubbot will sit in a loop and
check pull requests as with "-".

If you pass "~NNN" as the pull request, hubbot will just set the
status of that pull request to "error".  This will cause that pull
request to be considered as "needs verification" by the "-" and "+"
modes described above.

If the pull request is target at some other repo than
cockpit-project/cockpit, you can pass it as well:

    $ hubbot cgwalters/cockpit NNN
